## [DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology)

There are 3 major classes of such biopolymers: DNA and RNA (both nucleic
acids), and protein.

There are 3 Ã— 3 = 9 conceivable direct transfers of information that can occur
between these.

The dogma classes these into 3 groups of 3:
- three general transfers (believed to occur normally in most cells),
- three special transfers (known to occur, but only under specific conditions
  in case of some viruses or in a laboratory),
- and three unknown transfers (believed never to occur).

### General Transfers
3 general transfers describe the normal flow of biological information:
- DNA can be copied to DNA (DNA replication),
- DNA information can be copied into mRNA (transcription),
- and proteins can be synthesized using the information in mRNA as a template
  (translation).

### Special Transfers
3 special transfers describe:
- RNA being copied from RNA (RNA replication),
- DNA being synthesised using an RNA template (reverse transcription),
- and proteins being synthesised directly from a DNA template without the use
  of mRNA.

### Unknown Transfers
3 unknown transfers describe:
- a protein being copied from a protein,
- RNA synthesis using the primary structure of a protein as a template,
- DNA synthesis using the primary structure of a protein as a template.
